This is React Bookshelf App tht allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The App also allows users to add new books to the existing shelf by searching for books via an API. If books are found based on search term, the app allows users to add them to the shelf or update current shelf where the book is placed.
